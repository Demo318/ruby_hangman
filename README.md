# Command Line HANGMAN

This project is completed as a submission for the Object Oriented Programming: Hangman project in the Ruby Programming curriculum at [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com). A full description of the assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization?ref=lnav).

The goal of this project is to create a version of Mastermind that is playable version of Hangman in the command line. Learning goals include serializing data. Upon a player's starting a new game or entering `save`, a YAML file is updated with the current state. Upon starting the game, the YAML file is read to get a list of saved games for the player to choose from. All code was written by [Devin Mork](https://github.com/Demo318).

To execute the program: 1) Download the repository, 2) In the Command Line, navigate to the repository's home directory, 3) Enter `ruby play_hangman.rb`.
